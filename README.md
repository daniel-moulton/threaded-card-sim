A copy	 of	 your	 finished	 classes,	 and	 associated	 test	 classes	 and	 test	 suites,	 and	 any	
supporting	files,	in	a	zip file	named	cardsTest.zip.	The	zip file	should	include	both the	
bytecode	(.class)	and	source	files	(.java)	of	your	submission	(plus	any	testing	files	the	tests	
may	rely	upon),	and	a	README	file,	detailing	how	to	run	your test	suite


#How to run our test suite:

We are using JUnit 4.13.2.

To run our test suite, extract the cardsTest.zip into a new folder. Navigate to that folder via the command line. Within the folder, execute the following command:

Linux/Mac
- java -cp "lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:." test.JUnitTestRunner 

Windows
- java -cp "lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;." test.JUnitTestRunner
